# Overseas Funeral Guide / 海外奔丧指北


本项目源于美国境内几段沉重而真实的经历。
希望为海外奔丧、协助亲友处理后事的人，提供一份务实的流程指引与支持。


This project was born out of sorrow.
It is based on several real and difficult experiences in the US,
and aims to offer practical guidance for those who find themselves needing to handle the aftermath of a death abroad — whether for family, friends, or colleagues.

We hope that in moments of confusion and pain,
this guide can offer a sense of direction and support.
